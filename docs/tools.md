# Tools

Describes the current tool layer: the common tool contract, how tools are registered and dispatched, and what each built-in tool does at a high level.

---

## Purpose

The tool layer gives the runtime a typed interface for project-local actions.

Today that built-in tool set is intentionally small:

- `read_file`
- `list_dir`
- `search_code`
- `git_status`
- `git_diff`
- `git_log`
- `edit_file`
- `write_file`

The layer is built around explicit types rather than text parsing. Raw assistant text is parsed in `src/runtime/protocol/tool_codec.rs` before any tool is called, and the runtime may expose only a subset of registered tools on a given turn. Current tool-surface policy applies only to the read-only retrieval/Git families; `edit_file` and `write_file` are gated separately by mutation intent and approval.

---

## Core Contract

### `Tool`

Every tool implements the `Tool` trait in `src/tools/mod.rs`.

It exposes:

- `spec()` for static tool metadata
- `run()` for phase-one execution
- `execute_approved()` for phase-two execution when approval is required

Read-only tools only use `run()`. Mutating tools use both phases.

### `ToolInput`

The runtime never passes raw strings into tools. It passes one typed `ToolInput` variant:

- `ReadFile`
- `ListDir`
- `SearchCode`
- `GitStatus`
- `GitDiff`
- `GitLog`
- `EditFile`
- `WriteFile`

### `ToolOutput`

Completed tools return typed outputs:

- file contents
- directory listings
- search results
- git status / diff / log results
- edit confirmations
- write confirmations

The runtime later decides how those outputs are rendered for the model and for the TUI.

### `ToolRunResult`

`run()` returns one of two outcomes:

- `Immediate(ToolOutput)` for read-only work
- `Approval(PendingAction)` for proposed mutations

### `PendingAction`

`PendingAction` is the handoff object between the tool layer and the runtime approval flow.

It contains:

- `tool_name`
- `summary`
- `risk`
- `payload`

The runtime owns the approval lifecycle, but `payload` is opaque tool-owned data that is passed back into `execute_approved()`.

---

## Registry And Dispatch

`ToolRegistry` owns tool registration and lookup.

It is responsible for:

- registering tools by their `spec().name`
- dispatching typed `ToolInput` to the right tool
- delegating approved mutations back to the correct tool
- exposing sorted tool specs for the system prompt

The default registry is built in `src/tools/mod.rs` and initially registers only `read_file` and `list_dir`.

The remaining root-aware tools are added by `ToolRegistry::with_project_root(...)`:

- `search_code`
- `git_status`
- `git_diff`
- `git_log`
- `edit_file`
- `write_file`

---

## Path Resolution

`ToolContext` carries the discovered project root into each tool.

Relative paths:

- are resolved against the project root, not the process working directory

Absolute paths:

- are canonicalized for read-only tools and must still resolve within the project root
- are allowed for mutating tools only if they normalize within the project root

Mutating tools also reject `..` path traversal.

---

## Built-In Tools

### `read_file`

Reads a file and returns its contents immediately.

Current behavior:

- resolves paths against the project root
- reads raw bytes, then converts to UTF-8 lossily
- truncates to the first `200` lines
- reports line count and truncation status

Runtime behavior adds one guardrail around failed reads: if `read_file` cannot read the requested file, the runtime injects the tool error and emits a runtime-owned terminal answer instead of asking the model to retry repeatedly.

### `list_dir`

Lists the immediate contents of one directory.

Current behavior:

- does not recurse
- returns entry name, kind, and file size when available
- skips directories in `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`
- sorts directories before files
- sorts alphabetically within each group
- caps the returned listing at `200` entries and reports truncation metadata when the directory is larger

Runtime investigation behavior can block `list_dir` before `search_code` on code-location questions. Directory listings are still useful as a read-only tool, but they are not accepted as the first evidence step for investigation-required prompts.

### `search_code`

Searches recursively for lines containing a literal substring.

Current behavior:

- rejects empty queries
- walks the project tree recursively
- skips hidden directories and common build/output directories such as `target`, `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, and `build`
- searches only a fixed set of text-like extensions
- returns matching file path, line number, and line text
- collects up to `50` matches internally
- orders collected matches by file class before truncation: source files, then config/data files, then docs/text/unknown files
- preserves deterministic ordering within each file class
- shows up to `15` matches in the conversation output
- does not interpret the query as regex or semantic search

Rendered search output is grouped by file for model readability:

- each file group shows the file path and match count
- each file group shows up to `MAX_LINES_PER_FILE = 3` representative matching lines
- files with more shown matches include a per-file "showing" count

When exactly one source-tier file has a definition-like matching line, `tool_codec` prepends:

```text
[definition found in <file> — read this file first]
```

Definition detection is based on match content, not the search query. If zero or multiple source
files contain definition-like lines, no hint is rendered.

This grouping and hinting are presentation-only in `tool_codec`. The underlying typed data remains
the same: `SearchMatch` and `SearchResultsOutput` are unchanged, and runtime behavior does not
depend on parsing the grouped text. This is not a broad ranking system or query-intent classifier.

The typed input supports an optional scoped path, but the current model-facing wire format does not expose that scoped form yet.

Runtime behavior adds guardrails around the tool because prompt-only guidance was not enough for live local-model behavior:

- model-facing instructions ask for one plain literal keyword or identifier
- runtime simplifies phrase-like or method-like model queries to one literal token before dispatch
- each user turn gets one search, plus one retry only if the first search returned no matches
- after search is closed, additional `search_code` attempts are blocked by runtime correction
- investigation-required turns must read a file from the current search candidates before synthesis
- usage lookups reject definition-only reads as sufficient evidence when usage candidates exist
- after a definition-only read on a usage lookup, runtime can inject a bounded correction naming a concrete matched usage file
- definition lookups still accept a definition-file read as sufficient evidence

### `git_status`

Runs a fixed read-only status command and returns structured repository status information immediately.

Current behavior:

- runs a bounded `git status --short --branch`
- captures stdout/stderr with deterministic size limits
- truncates long status entry paths in rendered output
- returns a deterministic tool error when Git is unavailable or the project root is not a Git repository

This is not an arbitrary Git command runner. The tool takes no free-form arguments.

### `git_diff`

Runs a fixed read-only diff command and returns the current working-tree diff immediately.

Current behavior:

- runs a bounded `git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --no-color --`
- captures stdout/stderr with deterministic size limits
- returns structured diff text plus truncation metadata
- returns a deterministic tool error when Git is unavailable or the project root is not a Git repository

Like the other Git tools, this is intentionally narrow and argument-free.

### `git_log`

Runs a fixed read-only recent-history command and returns recent commits immediately.

Current behavior:

- runs a bounded recent-history log with `--max-count=20`
- disables pager/signature noise and uses short dates
- returns parsed commit entries with truncation metadata
- treats empty history and non-repo failures deterministically

### `edit_file`

Proposes an exact text replacement in an existing file.

Current behavior:

- requires a non-empty path and non-empty search text
- requires the search text to exist before approval is requested
- returns `Approval(PendingAction)` instead of mutating immediately
- uses `RiskLevel::Medium`
- re-checks that the search text still exists when approved
- replaces only the first occurrence

This tool is intentionally exact. It does not do fuzzy patching or diff application.

If the model tries to repair a malformed `edit_file` call after an edit tool error but still omits the required structure, the runtime injects an edit-specific correction and asks for a valid block instead of silently treating the malformed retry as a final answer.

The model-facing form remains the canonical `---search---` / `---replace---` block. For observed local-model drift, `tool_codec` also accepts narrow compatibility forms such as `old content:` / `new content:` labels and generic triple-dash delimiter pairs inside `[edit_file]...[/edit_file]`. Those still become exact `EditFile` inputs and go through normal validation and approval.

### `write_file`

Proposes creating or overwriting a file with full content.

Current behavior:

- requires a non-empty path
- returns `Approval(PendingAction)` instead of writing immediately
- uses `RiskLevel::Medium` for creates and `RiskLevel::High` for overwrites
- checks actual file existence again at execution time
- does not create missing parent directories

This is a full-file write tool, not an append or patch tool.

---

## What Tools Must Not Do

Tools must not:

- parse raw assistant output
- decide which tools are available for the current turn
- manage approval state after returning `PendingAction`
- write UI messages
- persist sessions
- depend on terminal state

Those responsibilities belong to the runtime, app/storage, and TUI layers.

---

## Current Limitations

- There are only eight built-in tools.
- There is no shell, web, or external integration tool.
- `search_code` uses a simple literal line substring search, not regex or semantic search.
- The current model-facing `search_code` wire format exposes only the plain query form, even though the typed input supports an optional scoped path.
- `edit_file` only replaces the first exact match.
- `write_file` does not create parent directories.
- Tool result rendering is optimized for the runtime and TUI, not for rich previews or diffs.
