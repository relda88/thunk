# Benchmark Run — 2026-04-29 — Pre-Phase 16 Baseline

Date: 2026-04-29  
Version: 0.8.30  
Backend: llama.cpp  
Model: qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m  
Machine: M2 Air 8GB

## Context

This run captures the behavior of the system immediately before Phase 16.

System state at this point:

- Runtime modularization complete (project, protocol, investigation, orchestration)
- Search → read → answer gating enforced
- Tool surface restrictions active
- Investigation modes and path scoping active
- Anchors implemented (last-read, last-search)
- Retrieval uses substring-based search (`search_code`)

Known limitations at this stage:

- No strict candidate enforcement after search
- Weak semantic ranking of search results
- Model can select incorrect files despite correct candidates
- Tool formatting fragile under small models
- Context window easily exceeded in multi-step flows

---

## Key Behaviors Being Measured

- retrieval correctness (file selection quality)
- search → read discipline
- handling of weak / broad queries
- failure behavior (search budget, terminals)
- mutation flow stability
- direct read behavior
- investigation flow correctness

## Notes

Key failures observed:

- Retrieval discipline is broken:
  - non-candidate reads allowed after search (initialization lookup, file explanation)
  - model can escape scoped search results

- Candidate selection is weak:
  - incorrect files chosen despite relevant candidates (filtering lookup)
  - drift to unrelated files after correct reads

- Grounding is inconsistent:
  - answers not aligned with read content (usage lookup, filtering lookup)

- Mutation reliability issues:
  - edit_file fails due to invalid tool formatting (small model limitation)

- Context limitations:
  - chained git operations exceed context window

- Anchor system:
  - functionally correct but inefficient (extra tool calls, unnecessary search)

This baseline defines targets for Phase 16:
- retrieval discipline enforcement
- candidate selection improvement
- grounding guarantees
- tool formatting robustness
